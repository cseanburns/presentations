# Introduction

The integration of digital technologies is revolutionizing the instructional
and research landscapes.

We have unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and intellectual inquiry.

Generative AI offers an additional tool to help with instruction, research,
collaboration, and inquiry, especially with respect to an understudied area of
science and scholarship:

**problem-finding** (especially for *ill-defined* problems)

# Motivation

Why is a focus on **problem-finding** important?

Whole disciplines are dedicated to *problem-solving* but part of getting an
education and part of being a great researcher is being able to ask **good
questions**.

> The role of outstanding scientists in influencing younger associates is
> repeatedly emphasized in the interviews with [Nobel] laureates. Almost
> invariably they lay great emphasis on the importance of problem-*finding*,
> not only problem-solving (Merton, 1968/1973, p. 453).

(Ed.), *The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations*

# Motivation

Why is a focus on **problem-finding** important?

> The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which
> may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill (Einstein &
> Infeld, 1938, p. 92, as cited in Abdulla & Cramond, 2018, p. 198).

And:

> Despite its theoretical and practical importance, it is surprising that PF
> \[problem-finding\] has received little attention ... (Abdull & Cramond, 2018,
> p. 200).

# Discursive

Generative AI, as a **chat bot**, offers a way to develop problem-finding
methodologies using discursive reasoning.

I define and use the term *discursive* in two ways:

- In education: types of teaching methods that involve **dialogue, discussion, or
  other forms of discourse** to facilitate learning
- In philosophy: a type of **reasoning** that proceeds through **argumentation and
  debate**
    - e.g., Socratic method

# Socratic method: Problem-finding

For example, through dialogue, discussion, argumentation, and debate, the Socratic method can be used to:

- Identify assumptions
- Raise question
- Explore alternatives
- Refine a problem
- Expose contradictions
- Engage in collective inquiry
- Reach a conclusion or identify further questions

# Motivation

But what's the problem I am responding to?

> Instructor: Ask ChatGPT how to think about X problem.

> Student asks one question and then stops.

# Discursive, Learning, and Problem-Finding

Why discursive?

- To promote independent learning and exploration. To learn how to ask **good questions** through dialogue, discussion, argumentation, and debate.
- Generative AI chat bots are *chat* (conversation) centered.

# Discursive, Learning, and Problem-Finding

Why discursive?

- Student led discursive practices may foster independent, critical thinkers

> To the extent that knowledge acquisition and academic performance are the
> goals, teacher-controlled methods of students' active learning are
> superior--especially for younger students and in well-structured subject
> domains. In contrast, if the goal is to help students to "learn to become
> **independent thinkers and learners** rather than simply become able to perform
> basic computations and retrieve simple knowledge and facts" [...], then
> methods in which **students have opportunities to learn more independently, to
> identify, define, and solve problems in different ways**, and to use acquired
> insights to overcome other tasks are more likely to be successful (Weinert &
> Helmke, 1995, p. 141).

- Generative AI can role play and discursive practices can foster acquisition
  of a discipline's lexicon and grammar (Lung, 2008)
