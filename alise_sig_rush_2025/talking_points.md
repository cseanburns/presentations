# Talking Points

- SIG Rush, September 10, 2025

## Intro

## SIGs serve a broader purpose

- they allow members to explore emerging or niche topics in a communal way, furthermore, these may not always fit into the larger ALISE structure (or any association's structure) but are essential for innovation in LIS education and research
- they provide a space for leadership development. They specifically offer newer members a pathway into broader association leadership (and this was true for me)

## Member benefits

- SIGs are low-barrier entry points for new members and for graduate students to get involved in ALISE right away (SIG proposals are also automatically accepted for annual conferences)
- SIGs encourage cross-institutional collaboration, and thus can lead to co-authored pubs, panels, or even grant projects

## Practical engagement

- SIGs are opportunities for pilot ideas. They can be places to test out new approaches, course concepts, or research agendas before scaling them up
- they help ensure that voices from diverse contexts, including academic, public, school, and special libraries but also international perspectives, practitioners, and scholars) are represented at ALISE conversations and annual meetings

## Connection to larger organization

- SIGs feed into ALISE's conference programming. Many panels and workshops originate from SIG efforts
- They can also be a way for ALISE to stay responsive to change, since SIGs can form, merge, or evolve as the field shifts

## Conclusion

- SIGs are the heart of community engagement in ALISE
- SIGs can form communities of practice and further our knowledge quite a bit in their areas and in new areas
- SIGs offer a way to stay engaged throughout the year

Finally, ALISE's new website offers all members, including SIGs, to use its social functions to coordinate, share information, engage, and maintain some SIG institutional history
