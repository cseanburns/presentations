    Dr. C. Sean Burns is an Associate Professor in the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. He will focus on "Shortcuts, Learning, and the Sacredness of Writing." Our culture sends mixed messages, stressing the importance of learning while rewarding the product, rather than the process. But learning is a process and not a product. When students use LLMs to take shortcuts in assignments, they reflect a deeper societal tension that prioritizes extrinsic outcomes over intrinsic learning. This raises the question: what do we truly value, the product or the process? If it is the product, then taking shortcuts is entirely rational. We send other mixed messages. We say that writing is thinking (Zinsser, 1988), but we think in other ways, too. Transcribing interviews fosters deep intimacy with the data. Manually calculating sums of squares for an ANOVA builds understanding of statistical reasoning. In these and other cases, this engagement transforms us into scholars and not just researchers. Yet, we have handed over both tasks to computers. Why, then, are some forms of thinking, like writing, held sacred while others are not? What rule determines which shortcuts are acceptable and which are not? Dr. Burns will explore this tension within the context of generative AI tools like LLMs. Drawing on his research on ungrading and Universal Design for Learning (UDL), he will challenge assumptions about assessment, learning, and technology's role in shaping how we engage with knowledge.

## Slide 1

- If learning is a process [@UZZEVEKD#stanovich00; @7XHFGUHA#kapur14] rather than a product,
- And processes require active engagement [@GLEP4G4M#david24], which we are averse to (the "law of less work" [@63ZAD45Z#kool10]),
- Then shortcuts (heuristics, cheating, etc) undermine learning.

## Slide 2

- If educators reward the product (summative) more than the process (formative) [@9PYM9XF3#edwards22],
    - (see also, learning versus performance [@6IQN57ZT#bjork11])
- And students respond rationally to rewards,
- Then shortcuts like LLM use become rational strategies
    - (see also, "mental effort is a limited resource" [@GLEP4G4M#david24]).

## Slide 3

- If we center some cognitive practices, like writing, that foster learning [@SAG7G6F7#zinsser88; @8FKUB2PU#anderson17],
- And other cognitive practices that foster learning (e.g., transcription, calculation) are outsourced to machines (CAQDAS, statistical software, etc),
- Then what we hold sacred for learning is a cultural choice, not an intrinsic necessity.

## Slide 4

- If we are inconsistent in which cognitive practices we hold sacred,
- And technology continues to automate more of them,
- Then the real question is not *whether* shortcuts are acceptable,
    - because we have willingly delegated some to machines (transcription, calculation),
    - but *who decides what counts as sacred in your classroom?*
