# Shortcuts, Learning, and the Sacredness of Writing

## Slide 1

- If learning is a process [@UZZEVEKD#stanovich00; @7XHFGUHA#kapur14] rather than a product,
- And processes require active engagement [@GLEP4G4M#david24], which we are averse to (the "law of less work" [@63ZAD45Z#kool10]),
- Then shortcuts (heuristics, cheating, etc) undermine learning.

## Slide 2

- If educators reward the product (summative) more than the process (formative) [@9PYM9XF3#edwards22],
    - (see also, learning versus performance [@6IQN57ZT#bjork11])
- And students respond rationally to rewards,
- Then shortcuts like LLM use become rational strategies
    - (see also, "mental effort is a limited resource" [@GLEP4G4M#david24]).

## Slide 3

- If we center some cognitive practices, like writing, that foster learning [@SAG7G6F7#zinsser88; @8FKUB2PU#anderson17],
- And other cognitive practices that foster learning (e.g., transcription, calculation) are outsourced to machines (CAQDAS, statistical software, etc),
- Then what we hold sacred for learning is a cultural choice, not an intrinsic necessity.

## Slide 4

- If we are inconsistent in which cognitive practices we hold sacred,
- And technology continues to automate more of them,
- Then the real question is not *whether* shortcuts are acceptable,
    - because we have willingly delegated some to machines (transcription, calculation),
    - but *who decides what counts as sacred in your classroom?*
