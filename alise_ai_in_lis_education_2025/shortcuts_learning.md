# Shortcuts, Learning, and the Sacredness of Writing

## Slide 1

- If learning is a process [@UZZEVEKD#stanovich00; @7XHFGUHA#kapur14] rather than a product,
- And processes require active engagement [@GLEP4G4M#david24]
    - which we're aversive to (see, the "law of less work" [@63ZAD45Z#kool10]),
- Then shortcuts (heuristics, cheating, etc) undermine learning.

## Slide 2

- If educators reward the product more than the process (e.g., summative vs. formative assessment: @9PYM9XF3#edwards22),
    - (see also, learning versus performance [@6IQN57ZT#bjork11])
- And students respond to such incentives,
- Then taking shortcuts (e.g., using LLMs) to produce products rather than show process is rational behavior;
    - (also, "mental effort is a limited resource" [@GLEP4G4M#david24]).

## Slide 3

- If some cognitive practices, like writing, foster learning [@SAG7G6F7#zinsser88; @8FKUB2PU#anderson17],
- And other cognitive practices that foster learning (e.g., transcription, calculation) are outsourced to machines (CAQDAS, statistical software, etc),
- Then how we valuate (hold sacred) selective cognitive practices reflects cultural decisions, and not any intrinsic requirment of learning.

## Slide 4

- If we are inconsistent in which cognitive practices we hold sacred,
- And technology continues to automate more of them,
- Then the real question is not *whether* shortcuts are acceptable
    - because we have already claimed they are (transcription, calculation),
    - but *who decides what counts as sacred thinking, and why?*
