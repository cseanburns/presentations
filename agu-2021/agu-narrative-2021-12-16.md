1. Slide 1
    - I think if you're attending this session or viewing it later, it's likely that you are inclined to support open science. I do, too. Despite that, my goal in this talk is to show that open science cannot, by itself, foster a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive science. Increased accessibility of knowledge may help, but in this talk, my goal is to make a case that we can think of open science as primarily a more complete realization of science itself. So, just science. But as a more complete realization, it will, without other interventions, more fully realize some of its systemic biases.
2. Slide 2
    - Science has long held openness and sharing as norms.
    - An open science extends upon and adds expectations to those norms. This is because of the affordances offered by the web, the internet, and associated technologies.
    - Thus, the opening of science reflects a more complete realization of long-held norms.
3. Slide 3
    - Despite these long held norms, science has historically been an exclusive community. Its exclusion of marginalized groups and underrepresented minorities has mirrored the exclusion of these groups in the broader society. 
    - Thus, openness is not itself solely y a solution for a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive science.
    - We can see this in comparable models of openness, such as in the open source software movement.
4. Slide 4
    - The open source movement shares similar goals and norms as open science, but it also shares similar problems. Both areas have seen improvements, but both have been and continue to be gendered and demographically homogeneous, and members and institutions in both areas can be overtly or subtly discriminatory.
    - Therefore, we should be cautious that the opening of science will result, without other interventions, in a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive science.
5. Slide 5
    - What a more open science offers, though, is a more transparent system.
    - Transparent systems can help reveal the invisible colleges, social circles, or social networks that exist and that fuel great amounts of scientific activity.
    - These social networks are important because participants in these networks, or members of these invisible colleges, command considerable influence over the questions, ideas, prestige awards, direction, etc of the practice of their discipline. That is, members or participants in these networks hold substantial social capital.
6. Slide 6
    - This is important to know because it's been shown that social capital, defined by connections between people, builds reciprocity, social trust, coordination, and reputation for its members and participants.
7. Slide 7
    - This is obviously problematic if that social capital excludes marginalized groups and underrepresented minorities.
    - And that's been the case in society in general and in the invisible colleges found in the sciences.
    - It has been shown that diversity threatens existing sources of social capital because it can involve redistributing that social capital.
    - But one way to address this issue is to redistribute that capital:
8. Slide 8
    - I am not an expert in DEI initiatives, but in some of our research, as an example, we have shown, with regards to gender bias in peer review, how social capital plays out.
    - women editorial board members of journals recruit more women to peer review than men, who recruit more men to review (Fox, Burns, & Meyer, 2015)
    - women are more likely to be authors on papers if the last (senior) author was female.
    - papers authored by women were more likely to be reviewed by women because women were more likely to be invited to review if the authors were women (Fox, Burns, Muncy, & Meyer, 2015).
    - when authors can suggest reviewers when submitting manuscripts, women are more likely to suggest women as potential reviewers (Fox, Burns, Muncy, & Meyer, 2016).
    - More broadly, in a separate study, we found that the level of socioeconomics on a per nation basis predicted success in the peer review process. So make the world a better place (Burns & Fox, 2017).
