6# Fostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Science

## Science and Open Science

**Science has long held openness and sharing as norms (Merton, 1973).**

In Robert Merton's (1973) piece on *The Normative Structure of Science,* he wrote that "full and open communication" is the idea that scientists hold that "The substantive findings of science are a product of social collaboration and are assigned to the community" and that "secrecy is the antithesis of this norm" (p. 273).

Questions to raise:

- whow counts as a scientist? who are the members of the community?
- what is included as "findings of science"?
- where does social collaboration take place? and who is involved?

He also wrote: "The institutional goal of science is the extention of certified knowledge" (p. 270).

- certification entails the things above: membership, findings, community

> The ethos of science is that affectively toned complex of values and norms which is held to be binding on the man of science. The norms are expressed in the form of prescriptions, proscriptions, preferences, and permissions. They are legitimized in terms of institutional values. These imperatives, transmitted by precept and example and reenforced by sanctions are in varying degrees internalized by the scientist, thus fashioning his scientific conscious ... (pp. 268-9).

- what values have we internalized in the process of becoming scientists? How are those values connected to the institutions that certify that knowledge?

**Open science extends upon and adds expectations to that due to technical affordances offered by the web and the internet.**

- At this point, open science does not represent a new kind of science but rather the potential to express and communicate more fully the process of doing science -- of making the work flow more visible.

## The Problem with Openness; (Open) Science and Open Source: Comparisons

**Openness as a system does not necessarily entail a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable system.**

**We suspect that the openness in open science does not necessarily entail better DEI because it does not entail better DEI in comparable models, like in open source software development.**

Although open science and open source share comparable goals such as transparancy, sharing, community ownernship, we find also comparable problems exist that can be traced back to more problems common in many areas of society. We find that, despite the *openness* in both models, both areas of work are still largely gendered, demographically homogeneous, and either overtly or subtly discriminatory.

It should be also noted that there is an overlap between these two areas. An open science might mean using and writing open source tools and programs that analyze data. 

## What Openness Does Offer for DEI

**However, as a potentially more transparent system, openness may reveal invisible colleges (Price & Beaver, 1966), social circles (Crane, 1969), or social networks (Zuccala, 2006).**

This is important because **invisible colleges include in-groups of scientists with considerable influence over questions, ideas, prestige, direction, etc of the practice of their discipline or field.**

**In summary, in-groups possess most of the social capital.** 

## Social Capital: Toward a DEI-Open Science

**Social capital "refers to features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit" (Putnam, 1995).**

**Social capital enhances, encourages, builds:**

- **Reciprocity**
- **Social trust**
- **Coordination**
- **Reputation**

**Putnam's work is directed at civic life, but it seems applicable to scientists who also form social organizations (including informal ones such as invisible colleges, social circles, social networks).**

Although Putnam's work is directed at civic life, broadly, it seems applicable especially under a specific view of science and scientists, a view that the philosopher of science, Susan Haack, argues for. Under this view, **science is not epistemologically privileged and scientists are not an epistemologically privileged group (Haack, 2007).** They may be espistemologically distinguished in the sense that they hold amongst themselves standards of rigor not always found among other areas of society, but their knowledge is not above exemption or immunity from the concerns of other members of their society.

## Diversity: Toward a DEI-Open Science

**Despite the promise that possessing social capital offers, social capital largely thrives when the demographic is homogeneous and dominant; in civic/poli-sci studies, also when issues like gender and racial equality are ignored (Levitsky & Ziblatt, 2018).**

**Increased diversity is a threat to those who hold the most social capital because it may inolve redistributing that capital.**

**Therefore, whether overt or subtle, there is often push back or inaction against attempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion (Hawes & Rocha, 2011) ...**

**... even in the academy and the sciences, including STEM related fields (Miriti, 2020).**
