## The Challenge with LMSs

Today I'll talk about using discussion boards. As a kind of preamble, I want to
note that Learning Management Systems (Canvas in our context, but most others,
too) are well designed for course management. They are good tools for
administering assignments, managing and communicating with students, assigning
grades, etc. However, by default they do not necessarily offer great learning
environments, and this is because the affordances (the actions users are able
to do by using them) by default lend themselves to lazy pedagogy. The main
fault is that online discussion boards take center stage in the LMS and
therefore influence this as the main activity of online learning, and not only
that, influence a very minimal kind of discussion activity. In other words,
unlike physical classroom spaces, which may afford a variety of learning
activities in those places, discussion forums seem to afford only one type of
learning activity: discussions. I'm a big believer that online learning can be
powerful, engaging, effective, and help build community, but it requires effort
and overcoming the defaults that LMSs offer. My suggestion then is to approach
the discussion forum technology in two ways:

## The Solution

1. Avoid it sometimes and use other aspects of Canvas or go outside Canvas for
   other active learning activities, and/or
2. Be creative with discussion forums and think of learning activities besides
   discussions.

## Theoretical / Research Guidance

1. What does learning mean?
2. How can this inform creating discussion forums as a place for learning?
3. How can I make discussion forums student-centered?

## Learning (broadly, a constructivist approach):

From [UC Berkeley][1], learning is:

- an active process
- "builds on prior knowledge"
- "occurs in a complex social environment"
- "is situated in an authentic context"
- "requires learners' motivation and cognitive engagement"

These are the kinds of things I try to think about when I design lessons and
activities or create discussion prompts, using discussion boards or other
tools. If I think about these things, it helps to keep me from my own default
laziness.

## Motivation => Student Participation

1. Motivation takes time for students to develop (students may be intimidated to start)
2. Instructors may need to be very active in the beginning
3. Students become more confident and proactive as the course progresses

Note: Even though students may be intimidated near the start of the course,
I've found that students often become quite engaged and that discussion forums
are places where students who might not be inclined to speak up in a f2f class
will do on discussion forums

## Motivation => Student Participation

1. Consider discussion prompts

## Motivation => Student Participation

1. Use rubrics to promote participation and creativity, resolve ambiguities, highlight expectations
2. Rubrics should be clear, encouraging, not punitive, highlight a path to learning

Note: One way to not be punitive is to assign different weights to the parts of
a rubric. For example, you can assess for writing mechanics but not deduct an
overwhelming number of points for minor grammatical issues, but then you can
let students know that you might adjust these weights over the course of the
semester if mechanics are not improved.

## Elements of Discussion Board Rubrics

Assess:

- Interactions (or collaboration)
- Content
- Engagement
- Tone
- Mechanics
- Quality over quantity

Note: Focus on quality of conversation and not on quantity. If you focus on
quantity, some students will respond with with meaningless posts that state
something like, "I agree with X", and that's all they post. Offer students
incentives (through grading, the rubric, etc.) to post only meaningful
comments.

I grade my discussion forums, but I assign less weight to them than I do to
other activities, like papers, etc. The entire discussion forum for a whole
semester may count toward 30% of the course grade, or less. It depends on the
course and the learning objectives. But because they do count toward the final
grade and because they're ongoing, I try to assess them very quickly, within
a day after they are due, so that students know how to modify their behaviors
going forward. I also leave them comments in the grade book (aside from
interacting with them on the boards). It doesn't have to be much. If their
discussions are fine or great, I just note that. If there are ways for them to
improve and to further the discussion, especially if I note patterns in a lack
of that, then I say so in the private comments.

Rubrics might change depending on the activity used in a forum. Regardless, the
rubric I use is based on the learning outcomes of the course and the course
design. If the course is discussion heavy, then the rubric might reward
students who advance the discussion and not just submit posts that have little
substance. But sometimes I use discussion forums not to discuss so much as
a kind of open homework site. I give them a series of tasks and they report
back their processes and outcomes, and the rubric that I use for that will be
different than a discussion heavy rubric.

## Instructor => Student Participation

Strategies to promote participation

- Be active
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- Highlight areas of consensus
- Acknowledge contributions
- Identify what works and what doesn't and revise strategies
- Send [personal emails][2] to low participating students

## Instructor => Student Participation

Mid-semester course evaluation

## Preparing Students: The Syllabus

- Have a discussion forum dedicated to the syllabus
- Identify how the syllabus (or course) is influence by a theory of learning, etc
- Require students to ask a question about the syllabus

## Preparing Students: Course Orientation

- Create a screen cast, navigate to course shell, etc.
- Be explicit about how the course works

## Creating Community

- Create an introduce yourself forum
- Create a general comments and questions forum
- Consider alternate tech to promote social

Note: Having a complex social context is an important part of learning, and
students do develop a sense of community on the boards. To bootstrap this,
I start all courses with an ungraded Introduce Yourself forum. I'll start by
introducing myself and ask students to do the same. I let students know to say
something personal, but that it's okay not be too personal. Whatever they're
comfortable with.

Note: I also create a General Comments/Questions non-graded forum for students
that is open all semester. Here I encourage students to ask any questions about
the course if they think they have a question that others might have, but to
feel free to email me if the question is more private.

## Course Architecture

- Use modules

I organize my discussion boards into several course modules. The modules
themselves are staged and build off each other but do so in a content dependent
way. For example, in my ICT 201 Personal Knowledge Management course, the main
idea is to develop a work flow that incorporates the different parts of
searching for information, collecting and curating it, advanced searching, and
then applying it, and the modules reflect these different states.

## Know When to Abandon Canvas (or any LMS)

- Use outside technology to promote active, student-centered learning

## Discussion Forum: Prompt Post

- Lecture video -- details about this
- Demo videos -- details about this

## Lecture Videos

- Discuss table from literature

## Discussion Forum: Prompt Post

1. Include links to readings
2. Include links to lecture transcripts
3. Include description of tasks, if relevant, or discussion prompts
4. If not including a lecture video, consider adding one to explain the task or
   the context behind the prompts

My discussion forums begin with my posts. I post a lecture, usually as a video
or an audio file, with a transcript, and then links to the readings, if online,
along with two or three discussion prompts. Sometimes I'll have students lead
discussions, and in such cases, I'll post the first response, also usually as
an audio or video. Audio and video are great for lectures. I can't advise that
you ask students to submit such things in place of texts, though, at least not
always, because then it can become time consuming to process all of them each
week.

## Discussion Forum: Learning Strategies

Go beyond Q&A. Some options.

1. Assign roles
2. Go beyond text as the basis for replies (photos, concept maps, etc.)
3. Go assignment rather than discussion based

Note: describe ERM organizational chart exercise that helps them model the
library and how it's organized and how that organization influences work flows,
job responsibilities, etc

## Discussion Forum: Learning Strategies

1. Group projects
2. Student led discussions and presentations
3. Observational learning
4. Play games
5. Problem-based learning (and anchored learning)

## Discussion Forum: Learning Strategies

- Use a discussion framework like 3CQ

## Discussion Forum: Learning Strategies

- Take a break

## Practical Gotchas

- Check that your forums are published
- Subscribe to your forums
- Activate threaded discussions

## Other Tips

- May need constraints (tell TA story)
- Respond to emails quickly, but
- Establish your boundaries
- Consider your audience

Note: In my experience, and from other anecdotal reports, I find that students
engage in discussion forums differently depending on how far along they are in
their education. First and second year undergraduates engage with online
discussion forums differently than third and fourth year undergraduates, and
graduate students behave differently than either. Students in the latter years
tend to be highly motivated to engage in online discussions than students in
the earlier years. This may not be universally true and may depend on the kind
of course that you're teaching, but it's been universally true in my years of
teaching online.
